# ImageSee
A simple and fast Image Viewer written in PyQt5/Qt

# WARNING:
This program is in  beta. Until v1.0.0 (or the whatever stable version), there will not be a guided installer. For all beta versions (v0.0.0 to v1.0.0), you can download the zip files. Otherwise, you can wait until I make the installer. Plus, v1.0.0 (and above) will be the finished program.

1. Go to the Releases and find the latest release.
2. Download the zip file.
3. Unzip it.
