# ImageSee
A simple and fast Image Viewer written in PyQt5/Qt

# WARNING:
This program is in  beta. Until v1.0.0 (or the whatever stable version), there will not be a guided installer. For all beta versions (v0.0.0 to v1.0.0), you can download the zip files. Otherwise, you can wait until I make the installer. Plus, v1.0.0 (and above) will be the finished program.

# Installation
**Note:** Support for Mac/Linux may or may not come, due to PyInstaller requiring a machine for each OS. While virtual machines are a thing, it's a hassle to do it every time, and so I won't do it, atleast when I can figure out an automation solution.

For v0.0.0 and up (except v1.0.0 and up):

1. Go to the Releases and find the latest release.
2. Download the zip file.
3. Unzip it.
4. Run the exe file.
